# PFPX Generated Flightplans
This is a collection of the flightplans that I have generated via [Professional Flight Planner X](http://www.flightsimsoft.com/pfpx/). 

**These flight plans are provided for reference only, and are not to be used for real world operations or navigation.**

All flight plans are provided as-is only, based on where I feel like flying on a particular day.

Some of these may be available and tracked via [my Vataware profile](https://www.vataware.com/pilot/1191215).
